Question 3
What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keyword in java explain with example.

'this' keyword points to the current object.
Whenever it is required to point an object from a method which is under execution because
of that object then we use 'this' keyword.

Following 3 main job of this keyword:
1. Points to the current class object.
2. Differentiate between local and instance variable.
3. Calling a constructor of a class from another constructor of the same class.

The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to immediate
parent class object.

Whenever you create the instance of a subclass, an instance of parent class is created
implicitly which is referred by the super reference variable.

Usage of Java super Keyword-
1. super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable.
2. super can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method.
3. super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.
