Transient
---------

->At the time of serialization, if we don't want to save the value of a variable for 
some security reasons, such variable should be declared with transient keyword.

->This keyword is applicable only for variables.

->Final variable will take part in serialization irrespective of whether it is declared 
 with transient keyword or not.
 
->static variable will not take part in serialization as they are not part of the object.
