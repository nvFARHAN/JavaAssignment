When we want to run block of code irrespective of if the exception is encountered
or not, then, we use finally block with try-catch block.
finally block will run in every condition except if we close the application manually
with System.exit(1) method or some serious errors like stackOverflow or system shutdown
etc.
eg - finally.java


final keyword is used with fields, methods or classes.
final field -> It means that the value of the field can't be changed.
final method -> It means that we can't override this method.
final class -> It means that the class can't be extended.

eg - final.java
